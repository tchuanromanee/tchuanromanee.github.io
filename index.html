    I’m born and raised in Ann Arbor. I went to Milwaukee School of Engineering for one year in undergrad, then Kettering University for the other 3 years. While attending Kettering University, I worked for Bosch for four three-month terms. My previous areas of work include embedded systems, website development and administration, computer vision and image analysis, machine learning, and accounting and bookkeeping.

    I like to tinker with website and content management (eg. Drupal, Django, JavaScript, VueJS, etc), managing websites for multiple organizations and my own blog.
