Evaluation and Comparison of Usability of Four Mobile Breathing Training Visualizations

Breath training has been shown to reduce stress and anxiety and improve physiological health. Traditionally, teaching breathing techniques involved in-person guidance or using audio recordings. The increasing prevalence of mobile applications has resulted in many different breathing visualization methods. However, limited work has been done in investigating the effectiveness of these visual representations with respect to breathing guidance. We evaluate four common visual representations of the breath used to teach breathing techniques and investigate the role that auditory guidance plays in users’ experience of these applications. We develop a mobile interface containing these four representations and use a within-subjects approach. Each participant uses four different types of representations, each with and without audio. Then, we interview and survey participants to gather their thoughts on each representation. We identify potential usability issues with the representations and from the data collected, suggest design criteria for future development of app-supported breath training.


An observational and interview-based study of the undergraduate admissions process

Holistic admissions is a complex and subjective decision making domain in which application readers attempt to identify students who are both capable of succeeding at a university or college and that fit the needs of the institution. A common part of the process is “committee review” where admissions officers discuss the merits of an applicant that may not be a clear admit or reject decision. In this meeting, an admissions officer is typically responsible for “representing” that applicant for the rest of the committee and arguing for admission. From prior studies, we suspected that narrative visualization techniques might be appropriate for this process, thus, we conducted a series of participatory design workshops with admissions officers at the University of Notre Dame to better understand the challenges and opportunities in collecting and presenting evidence as narratives in a typical holistic admissions “committee meeting”. Based on those workshops, we present designs ideas in support of collaborative decision making and storytelling in the holistic admissions domain with a particular emphasis on identifying appropriate narrative visualization genres in support of this process. We also draw parallels to other similar situations where our findings stand to inform the design of software tools in support of collaborative review processes.
